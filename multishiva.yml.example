# MultiShiva Configuration Example
# This is a host configuration - the machine that others connect to

version: 1
self_name: "host"
mode: host
port: 53421

# TLS Pre-Shared Key - MUST be the same on all machines
tls:
  psk: "change-this-to-a-secure-random-string"

# Define which machines are on which edges of your screen
# Supported edges: right, left, top, bottom
edges:
  right: "agent1"  # Machine to the right of this one
  # left: "agent2"
  # top: "agent3"
  # bottom: "agent4"

# Optional: Hotkey configuration
hotkeys:
  focus_return: "Ctrl+Alt+H"  # Return focus to host
  kill_switch: "Ctrl+Alt+K"   # Emergency stop

# Optional: Behavior tuning
behavior:
  edge_threshold_px: 10      # Distance from edge to trigger switch (pixels)
  friction_ms: 100           # Delay before switching (milliseconds)
  reconnect_delay_ms: 5000   # Time to wait before reconnecting (milliseconds)
