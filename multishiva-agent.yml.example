# MultiShiva Agent Configuration Example
# This is an agent configuration - a machine that connects to a host

# TLS Pre-Shared Key - MUST be the same as the host
tls:
  psk: "change-this-to-a-secure-random-string"

  left: "host"     # Host is to the left
  right: "agent2"  # Another agent to the right

  # bottom: "agent4"

# Optional: Hotkey configuration
